# Tanu

*Connecting UMD Students with one fresh fade, perfect lash set, and flawless manicure at a time.*

## What is Tanu?

Tanu is an **in-progress, university-exclusive marketplace** that lets UMD students who run **cosmetic businesses** (hair stylists, barbers, makeup artists, nail techs, lash artists, etc.) showcase their work and manage appointmentsâ€”all while helping fellow students quickly find the beauty services they need right on campus.

## Why weâ€™re building it&nbsp;ðŸ’¡

- **Spotlight student entrepreneurs** â€“ Give campus creatives a professional-looking storefront without the overhead of Instagram DMs or endless group-chat promos.  
- **Keep dollars on campus** â€“ Make it dead-simple for Terps to support Terps instead of traveling off-campus or paying salon premiums.  
- **Streamline scheduling** â€“ Replace scattered text threads with a clean booking flow and automatically track upcoming & past appointments for both clients and businesses.
